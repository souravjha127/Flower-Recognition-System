# 🌸 Flower Recognition System: Image Classification Dashboard
An interactive Streamlit-based web application that identifies flower species from uploaded images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built for quick, reliable, and user-friendly flower detection and exploration.

## Tech Stack
The project was built using the following tools and technologies:

🐍 Python – Programming language for model development and app logic.

🤖 TensorFlow / Keras – Deep learning frameworks used to build and train the CNN model.

📊 Pandas & NumPy – Dataset handling and preprocessing.

🎨 OpenCV / PIL – Image preprocessing and transformation.

🧑‍💻 Jupyter Lab – Development, training, and experimentation environment.

🌐 Streamlit – Web framework for building the interactive interface.

📂 GitHub – Source control and dataset storage.

## Data Source
Source: Custom dataset created with multiple flower categories (e.g., Rose, Sunflower, Dandelion, etc.), combined with public datasets.
The dataset includes:

* 📷 Images – Flower photos in different conditions (angles, lighting).
* 🏷 Labels – Flower species for supervised learning.
* 🛠 Preprocessed dataset used for training to improve model performance.

## Features / Highlights
Business Problem:
-Identifying flowers manually requires botanical knowledge and can be time-consuming. A system that classifies flowers automatically can assist students, researchers, and nature enthusiasts.

## Goal of the Dashboard
To create a real-time, browser-based flower recognition tool that:
- Accurately predicts flower species from an image.
- Provides a user-friendly way to explore different flowers.
- Demonstrates the application of computer vision and deep learning in real-world scenarios.

## Walkthrough of Key Components

- 📂 Drag & Drop / Upload Box – Users can upload a flower image.
- 🎯 Prediction Output Panel – Displays predicted flower name instantly.
- 📈 Model Confidence Score – Shows probability of prediction.
- 🖼 Preprocessing Pipeline – Resizing, normalization, and augmentation for robust classification.
- 🌐 Streamlit Interface – Simple and interactive UI, no coding required.

## Business Impact & Insights
🌍 Education – Helps students and nature lovers identify flowers easily.

🧪 Research – Assists botanists in large-scale flower classification tasks.

📱 Mobile/IoT Integration – Can be adapted into mobile apps for field use.

💡 ML Demonstration – Great showcase of CNN and image recognition applied to real-world data.
